# Parameter Estimation

Parameter estimation for ODE models is provided by the DiffEq suite. The current
functionality includes `build_loss_objective` and `lm_fit`. Note these require
that the problem is defined using a [ParameterizedFunction](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ParameterizedFunctions.jl).

## build_loss_objective

`build_loss_objective` builds an objective function to be used with Optim.jl and MathProgBase-associated solvers like NLopt.

```julia
function build_loss_objective(prob::DEProblem,alg,loss_func;
                              mpg_autodiff = false,
                              verbose_opt = false,
                              verbose_steps = 100,
                              prob_generator = problem_new_parameters,
                              kwargs...)
```

The first argument is the DEProblem to solve, and next is the `alg` to use.
One can also choose `verbose_opt` and `verbose_steps`, which, in the optimization routines, will print the steps and the values at the steps every
`verbose_steps` steps. `mpg_autodiff` uses autodifferentiation to define the
derivative for the MathProgBase solver. The extra keyword arguments are passed
to the differential equation solver.

### The Loss Function

```julia
loss(sol)
```

is a function which reduces the problem's solution. While this is very
flexible, a two convenience routines is included for fitting to data:

```julia
L2Loss(t,data)
CostVData(t,data;loss_func = L2DistLoss)
```

where `t` is the set of timepoints which the data is found at, and
`data` which are the values that are known. `L2Loss` is an optimized version
of the L2-distance. In `CostVData`, one can choose any loss function from
LossFunctions.jl or use the default of an L2 loss.

### The Problem Generator

The argument `prob_generator` allows one to specify a the function for generating
new problems from a given parameter set. By default, this just builds a new
version of `f` that inserts all of the parameters. For example, for ODEs this
is given by the dispatch on `DiffEqBase.problem_new_parameters` that does the
following:

```julia
function problem_new_parameters(prob::ODEProblem,p)
  f = (t,u,du) -> prob.f(t,u,p,du)
  uEltype = eltype(p)
  u0 = [uEltype(prob.u0[i]) for i in 1:length(prob.u0)]
  tspan = (uEltype(prob.tspan[1]),uEltype(prob.tspan[2]))
  ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)
end
```

`f = (t,u,du) -> prob.f(t,u,p,du)` creates a new version of `f` that encloses
the new parameters. The element types for `u0` and `tspan` are set to match the
parameters. This is required to make autodifferentiation work. Then the new
problem with these new values is returned.

One can use this to change the meaning of the parameters using this function. For
example, if one instead wanted to optimize the initial conditions for a function
without parameters, you could change this to:

```julia
my_problem_new_parameters = function (prob::ODEProblem,p)
  uEltype = eltype(p)
  tspan = (uEltype(prob.tspan[1]),uEltype(prob.tspan[2]))
  ODEProblem(prob.f,p,tspan)
end
```

which simply matches the type for time to `p` (once again, for autodifferentiation)
and uses `p` as the initial condition in the initial value problem.

## build_lsoptim_objective

`build_lsoptim_objective` builds an objective function to be used with LeastSquaresOptim.jl.

```julia
build_lsoptim_objective(prob,tspan,t,data;prob_generator = problem_new_parameters,kwargs...)
```

The arguments are the same as `build_loss_objective`.

## lm_fit

`lm_fit` is a function for fitting the parameters of an ODE using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm. This algorithm is really bad and thus not recommended since, for example,
the Optim.jl algorithms on an L2 loss are more performant and robust. However,
this is provided for completeness as most other differential equation libraries
use an LM-based algorithm, so this allows one to test the increased effectiveness
of not using LM.

```julia
lm_fit(prob::DEProblem,tspan,t,data,p0;prob_generator = problem_new_parameters,kwargs...)
```

The arguments are similar to before, but with `p0` being the initial conditions
for the parameters and the `kwargs` as the args passed to the LsqFit `curve_fit`
function (which is used for the LM solver). This returns the fitted parameters.

## Local Optimization Examples

We choose to optimize the parameters on the Lotka-Volterra equation. We do so
by defining the function as a [ParmaeterizedFunction](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ParameterizedFunctions.jl):


```julia
f = @ode_def_nohes LotkaVolterraTest begin
  dx = a*x - b*x*y
  dy = -c*y + d*x*y
end a=>1.5 b=1.0 c=3.0 d=1.0

u0 = [1.0;1.0]
tspan = (0.0,10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)
```

Notice that since we only used `=>` for `a`, it's the only free parameter.
We create data using the numerical result with `a=1.5`:

```julia
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5())
t = collect(linspace(0,10,200))
randomized = [(sol(t[i]) + .01randn(2)) for i in 1:length(t)]
using RecursiveArrayTools
data = vecvec_to_mat(randomized)
```

Here we used `vecvec_to_mat` from [RecursiveArrayTools.jl](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/RecursiveArrayTools.jl)
to turn the result of an ODE into a matrix.

If we plot the solution with the parameter at `a=1.42`, we get the following:

![Parameter Estimation Not Fit](../assets/paramest_notfit.png)

Notice that after one period this solution begins to drift very far off: this
problem is sensitive to the choice of `a`.

To build the objective function for Optim.jl, we simply call the `build_loss_objective`
funtion:

```julia
cost_function = build_loss_objective(prob,Tsit5(),L2Loss(t,data),maxiters=10000)
```

Note that we set `maxiters` so that way the differential equation solvers would
error more quickly when in bad regions of the parameter space, speeding up the
process. Now this cost function can be used with Optim.jl in order to get the parameters.
For example, we can use Brent's algorithm to search for the best solution on
the interval `[0,10]` by:

```julia
using Optim
result = optimize(cost_function, 0.0, 10.0)
```

This returns `result.minimizer[1]==1.5` as the best parameter to match the data.
When we plot the fitted equation on the data, we receive the following:

![Parameter Estimation Fit](../assets/paramest_fit.png)

Thus we see that after fitting, the lines match up with the generated data and
receive the right parameter value.

We can also use the multivariate optimization functions. For example, we can use
the `BFGS` algorithm to optimize the parameter starting at `a=1.42` using:

```julia
result = optimize(cost_function, [1.42], BFGS())
```

Note that some of the algorithms may be sensitive to the initial condition. For more
details on using Optim.jl, see the [documentation for Optim.jl](http://www.juliaopt.org/Optim.jl/latest/).

Lastly, we can use the same tools to estimate multiple parameters simultaneously.
Let's use the Lotka-Volterra equation with all parameters free:

```julia
f2 = @ode_def_nohes LotkaVolterraAll begin
  dx = a*x - b*x*y
  dy = -c*y + d*x*y
end a=>1.5 b=>1.0 c=>3.0 d=>1.0

u0 = [1.0;1.0]
tspan = (0.0,10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f2,u0,tspan)
```

To solve it using LeastSquaresOptim.jl, we use the `build_lsoptim_objective` function:

```julia
cost_function = build_lsoptim_objective(prob,Tsit5(),L2DistLoss(t,data))
```

The result is a cost function which can be used with LeastSquaresOptim. For more
details, consult the [documentation for LeastSquaresOptim.jl](https://github.com/matthieugomez/LeastSquaresOptim.jl):

```julia
x = [1.3,0.8,2.8,1.2]
res = optimize!(LeastSquaresProblem(x = x, f! = cost_function,
                output_length = length(t)*length(prob.u0)),
                LeastSquaresOptim.Dogleg(),LeastSquaresOptim.LSMR(),
                ftol=1e-14,xtol=1e-15,iterations=100,grtol=1e-14)
```

We can see the results are:

```julia
println(res.minimizer)

```

and thus this algorithm was able to correctly identify all four parameters.

## More Algorithms (Global Optimization) via MathProgBase Solvers

The `build_loss_objective` function builds an objective function which is able
to be used with MathProgBase-associated solvers. This includes packages like
IPOPT, NLopt, MOSEK, etc. Building off of the previous example, we can build a
cost function for the single parameter optimization problem like:

```julia
f = @ode_def_nohes LotkaVolterraTest begin
  dx = a*x - b*x*y
  dy = -c*y + d*x*y
end a=>1.5 b=1.0 c=3.0 d=1.0

u0 = [1.0;1.0]
tspan = (0.0,10.0)
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan)
sol = solve(prob,Tsit5())

t = collect(linspace(0,10,200))
randomized = [(sol(t[i]) + .01randn(2)) for i in 1:length(t)]
data = vecvec_to_mat(randomized)

obj = build_loss_objective(prob,Tsit5(),L2DistLoss(t,data),maxiters=10000)
```

We can now use this `obj` as the objective function with MathProgBase solvers.
For our example, we will use NLopt. To use the local derivative-free
Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations algorithm, we can simply do:

```julia
using NLopt
opt = Opt(:LN_COBYLA, 1)
min_objective!(opt, obj)
(minf,minx,ret) = NLopt.optimize(opt,[1.3])
```

This finds a minimum at `[1.49997]`. For a modified evolutionary algorithm, we
can use:

```julia
opt = Opt(:GN_ESCH, 1)
min_objective!(opt, obj.cost_function2)
lower_bounds!(opt,[0.0])
upper_bounds!(opt,[5.0])
xtol_rel!(opt,1e-3)
maxeval!(opt, 100000)
(minf,minx,ret) = NLopt.optimize(opt,[1.3])
```

We can even use things like the Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy
(and add constraints if needed). This is done via:

```julia
opt = Opt(:GN_ISRES, 1)
min_objective!(opt, obj.cost_function2)
lower_bounds!(opt,[-1.0])
upper_bounds!(opt,[5.0])
xtol_rel!(opt,1e-3)
maxeval!(opt, 100000)
(minf,minx,ret) = NLopt.optimize(opt,[0.2])
```

which is very robust to the initial condition. The fastest result comes from the
following:

```julia
using NLopt
opt = Opt(:LN_BOBYQA, 1)
min_objective!(opt, obj)
(minf,minx,ret) = NLopt.optimize(opt,[1.3])
```

For more information, see the NLopt documentation for more details. And give IPOPT
or MOSEK a try!
